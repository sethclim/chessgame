# Chess Game
ChessGame made in unity for the UWP framework.  I implemented and learned about game logic with an object-oriented design, lighting, saving to a binary file.  As well as, saving player preferences, and UI in unity.  I used Visual Studio for scripting and debugging, and the project was managed with version control.
